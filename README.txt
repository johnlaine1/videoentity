==========
Use this module as a tool to aid in the creation of custom entity types.
Using git you will find that this repo is broken up into sections.

AFTER converting a step to your needs (changing function & variable names, etc),
perform the steps outlined in each section to ensure the code is correct up to
that point.

I will use the terms of this original module, such as go to /videoentity.

Step ONE Chapter 6 
  Enable the module (Install and uninstall using devel if it has been previously installed)
  Manually add one or more records to the base table for the entity.
  Go to /videoentity , you should see a demo page with 1 or 2 krumo outputs
    that show the data that you entered into the database.
